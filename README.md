# Outdated game engine: Trident

### One of my first personal projects, keeping it on Github for nostalgic value.

If you want to check out decent code, I want to redirect you to https://github.com/Tdead1/TiFrame which is the new and improved version of the same thing. The idea behind this project was to provide a C++ 3D framework, which I could then use to prototype features I made in C++. At some point, I decided to drop this project and start anew.
